## üìå Project Overview
Implemented **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to create secure development and production environments with granular permissions. Key achievements:
- Created **tag-based access control** for EC2 instances
- Designed IAM policies using **JSON** to restrict destructive actions
- Established **user groups** with inherited permissions
- Tested policy enforcement through practical scenarios

## üîß AWS Services Used
- **IAM** (Users, Groups, Policies)
- **EC2** (Environment tagging: `production`/`development`)
- **AWS Account Alias** (Custom login URL)

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Implementations

    }
  }
}
